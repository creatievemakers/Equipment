## ENVIRONMENTAL SENSING
This demo uses the sensors of the CM³ maker space to allow us to sense aspects or element in our environment that are hidden our invisible to our human senses.  These layers range from  invisible atmospheric conditions such as light, temperature, sound, moisture, air and soil qualities to electromagnetic communications signals, like wifi, gsm, radio... to traces of use, occupation, inhabitation, to online data, social media post, images, videos, metadata, tags...  The data captured trough different  sensors, data scraping, photogrammetry or scanning  can be processed and represented as tempo-spatial visualisations, maps, plots, 3D models, animations... Through media like print,  screens, projections, VR and AR technology, these can be made visible and tangible.  The extension of our capacities to sense our environments allows us to adapt our habitual and disciplinary perspectives, and form the basis for novel forms of creating, designing and making, which in turn impacts the environment.  As such environmental sensing becomes part of iterative design or artistic processes, in which technologies extends our spatial and environmental awareness.

## HYBRID CRAFTING 
This demo explores how digital technologies of the CM³ makerspace can be used to capture, augment physical making or crafting processes. Crafting, which can be defined as the skill or dexterity of making with certain tools and media, often relies on tacit knowledge that is acquired through practice and imitation in addition as explicit knowledge that can be taught.  Crucial to crafting is that the outcomes of the making process are not determined beforehand, but qualities and properties of the work are being defined through making. While crafting has been mainly used to describe material and hands-on making processes, this can be extended through processes of digital making.  Digital making relies on explicit skills of understanding digital software interfaces, or even code, when practiced they can become internalised, or interfaces can be designed to intuitive, to afford digital crafting.  This demo starts from physical and material making, which are digitised during the process of making, building a timelapse of how the artefact was made. Additionally each of those digital copies can be the starting point of a further digital making process, modifying them in a VR environment.  Through digital fabrication technologies such as 3D printing, cnc milling or laser cutting, we can materialise these digital models, closing the loop between material and digital, resulting in a hybrid crafting process. 

## AUGMENTED COLLABORATION
This demo uses the mixed reality (MR) technology of the CM³ to collaborate in designing and making technical and artistic artefacts and architectural installations.  In architecture, arts and engineering, meeting in physical space for brainstorming and design ideation are essential for collaboration. Walls, tables pen and paper become surfaces for exchanging and testing design ideas.  Digital tools increasingly support similar processes of collaboration, as we all have learned through the recent covid 19 pandemic.  Moreover, digital tools provide benefits for capturing and streamlining design processes, such as exploring design variations, version tracking, and allow for a shared authorship...  In this demo we will use parametric modelling and computational design to generate variations of structures, evaluate and evolve, collaboratively we will make a selection of structures to be realised  as scale 1:1 installations.  Rather than using plans and sections we will use the Augmented Reality to project a digital model of the final structure and the overlaying metadata with instructions on how to assemble it.  Through 3D scanning and sensors we  can continually measure how the physical structures differentiate from the digital model, and adapt either if necessary.
